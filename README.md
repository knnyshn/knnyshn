Hello strangers!

As a software engineer, I am constantly inspired by the limitless possibilities of technology and the impact it can have on the world. My bigger goal is to leverage my technical expertise to create innovative solutions that improve peopleâ€™s lives. Drawing from my experiences in customer service and my background as a creative (musician), I approach software development with a unique perspective that allows me to understand the user and create intuitive interfaces. With full stack technical skills, I am excited to showcase my abilities in front-end development, back-end architecture, and database management to build user-friendly software applications.

JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose
