Hey, I'm Kenny Shin and I am a full stack developer that loves the creativity of front-end and the rigid structure of back-end. I am more experienced with front-end although I wish to learn more and dive deeper into AI and back-end languages/tools. I am an eager learner and love technology so this will be very interesting and fun journey for me.

In my non-coding time I play bass, sound design, and go out to shows. 

Tools and Languages: 
JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Python, PostgreSQL, Django, MongoDB, Mongoose


Feel free to contact me or view my stuff!
